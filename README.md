# About me:
Hey, I am Agnieszka. I have always been drawn to technical skills and that is why I graduated in Physics. I am looking for a career for me where I belong and I could be happy. Coding seems perfect to me, because I really like to think and solve problems, and that's what coding is about.
Completing this task was a real fun for me, but at the same time, it made me realize I still have a lot to learn. I would like to develop my programming skills and I am convinced that getting into the Academy would give me this opportunity.
